# Eye-Exercise

This app creates an image of eyes using CSS. The center of the eyes or the balls of the eyes follow the location of the pointer using javascript and update the CSS and DOM to give the impression that the eyes are moving by updating the location or x and y coordinates of the eye balls.  



Roadmap of future improvements: Future improvments might be to make the program more interactive. The pointer location could illuminate a small circle area on the page and search for a switch randomly located on the page. Whe switched on it could briefly show a whole face instead of just eyes.
